I also have a podcast in which I interview smart people in my life. It's fun.\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\n## [Data mining 40,000+ oncology studies on ClinicalTrials.gov](https://michaelshea88.github.io/Mining-ClinicalTrials.gov/)\r\nClinicalTrials.gov is a government-funded registry of over 200,000 clinical trials of drugs and medical devices. Starting in 2007, virtually all major studies that have at least one open site in the United States are required by law to be registered on the site. Here I visualize some of aspects of the data I found most interesting using interactive Plotly charts.\r\n\r\n## [Data warehousing and text classification](https://michaelshea88.github.io/Cuisine-Classifier/)\r\nThis was my capstone project for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program. In it I collect data from an API, store it on a PostgreSQL instance I generated on AWS, use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to prepare a corpus of text data for a classification task, and then deploy a series of models and compare their accuracy scores. \r\n\r\n# Publications\r\n### [Use of FDA-Approved and Laboratory-Developed Tests in Advanced Nonâ€“Small Cell Lung Cancer: Results of a Retrospective Market Analysis](http://www.personalizedmedonc.com/publications/pmo/september-2016-vol-5-no-7/use-of-fda-approved-and-laboratory-developed-tests-in-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-results-of-a-retrospective-market-analysisceline-m-audibert-phd1-michael-b-shea2-daniel-j-glass/)\r\nWe investigated the rate of FDA-approved testing in non-small cell lung cancer using a patient chart audit. Published in the journal *Personalized Medicine in Oncology* in September, 2016.\r\n\r\n### [Regulatory watch: Impact of breakthrough therapy designation on cancer drug development](http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v15/n3/full/nrd.2016.19.html)\r\nWe compared characteristics of novel anticancer drugs approved with and without breakthrough designation from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 using the online database Drugs@FDA. Published in the journal *Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery* in March, 2016.\r\n\r\n### [A Century of Medical Product Regulation: The Historic Framework for Personalized Medicine in Oncology](http://www.personalizedmedonc.com/publications/pmo/march-2016-vol-5-no-2/a-century-of-medical-product-regulation-the-historic-framework-for-personalized-medicine-in-oncology/)\r\nA lengthy overview of the policies and regulations that made the FDA what it is today, written in the context of personalized medicine. Published in the journal *Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery* in March, 2016.\r\n\r\n### [Regulatory Decision-making Meets the Real World](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/313/313fs46)\r\nThis study explores how to expand patient input in the drug development process and incorporate real-world evidence into regulatory decisions. Published in the journal *Science Translational Medicine* in November, 2015.\r\n\r\n### [Use of Multiple Endpoints and Approval Paths Depicts a Decade of FDA Oncology Drug Approvals](http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/19/14/3722.full?sid=93257711-a0f5-4de5-b8bf-09aac2069a22)\r\nA review of endpoints used in pivotal trials of cancer drugs approved in the United States over a ten year period. Published in the journal *Clinical Cancer Research* in July, 2013.\r\n",
